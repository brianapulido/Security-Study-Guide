1.0 Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities
1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques
Social engineering: eliciting information from someone or getting them to perform some action for the threat actor; can be used to gather intel. 74
• Phishing: social engineering + spoofing; email-based attack where attacker sends email from a seemingly trusted source to try to elicit private info from victim or to infect with malware. 77
• Smishing: SMS (text) phishing to trick a person into revealing info. 78
• Vishing: voice over IP phishing to trick a person into revealing info. 78
• Spam: unsolicited email that gets sent in masse. 78
• Spam over instant messaging (SPIM): spam attack through text messaging. 79
• Spear phishing: email-based phishing that targets specific individuals. 78
• Dumpster diving: discovering things about an organization based on what it throws away. 76
• Shoulder surfing: peeking over someone’s shoulder to obtain password or PIN as they type it. 77
• Pharming: impersonation attack where a request for a website is redirected to a fake website. 79
• Tailgating: following closely behind someone to gain access to a building that has a key card entry. 76
• Eliciting information: extracting information during a seemingly normal & innocent conversation
• Whaling: spear fishing attack aimed at upper-level management/senior execs or wealthy people. 78
• Prepending: adding text that appears to have been generated by the email system. 79
• Identity fraud: impersonation. attacker uses specific details of someone’s identity. Name, address. 77
• Invoice scams: type of identity fraud, spoof invoice details of genuine supplier but change bank acct #
• Credential harvesting: steal account credentials through pharming, malvertising or injected scripts. 80
• Reconnaissance: gathering information about the target computer systems, supply chains to prepare for an attack. 76
• Hoax: examples are security alerts or chain emails intended to deceive the victim. 79
• Impersonation: pretending to be someone else. 75
• Watering hole attack: attacker targets specific groups or organizations through injecting malicious code into the websites the people tend to frequent such as an insecure third part website. 79
• Typosquatting: attacker registers a domain name with a common misspelling of an existing domain so that a user who misspells the URL in a browser is taken to the attacker’s website... URL hijacking. 79
• Pretexting: attacker comes up with a fabricated story to gain victim’s trust and manipulate them into sharing sensitive info, downloading malware, sending money etc. 75
• Influence campaigns: major program launched by an adversary with a high level of capability such as a nation-state actor, terrorist group or hacktivist group. Goal is to shift public opinion on a topic. 80
- Hybrid warfare: conventional and unconventional actions such as espionage, disinformation campaigns/fake news, hacking, cyber-attacks, election meddling. 80
 - Social media: hoaxes can be widely spread through social media. 80
• Social Engineering Principles (reasons for effectiveness) 75
- Authority/intimidation: people find it difficult to refuse a request by someone they perceive as superior… use intimidation or technical arguments and jargon… people don’t want to admit ignorance
- Consensus/social proof: people will act as they think others would act… be persuaded into thinking that to refuse a request would be odd/something people don’t normally say no to
- Scarcity/urgency: target is pressured to make a quick response or is made to believe it is a limited time offer
 	- Familiarity/liking: social engineer is affable and likeable and presents requests as reasonable 
 	- Trust: impersonator establishes trust with target with use of privileged info 

1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack.
• Malware: software that is intentionally designed to cause disruption/perform malicious actions
 	- Ransomware: malware that is used to try to extort money from the victims. 88
- Trojans: malware concealed within an installer package for software that appears to be legitimate. Tries to compromise the security of the computer. 82
- Worms: malware that replicates in system memory and can spread over network connections rather than infecting files… don’t need user intervention to run. 84
- Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs): software installed alongside a package selected by the user or perhaps bundled with a new computer system. Grayware. 82
- Fileless virus: does not write code to disk, uses memory resident techniques to run its processes; uses lightweight shellcode to achieve a backdoor mechanism on the host to evade detection; uses legitimate system scripting tools to execute payload actions. Resides in RAM… within a Powershell script. 85
- Command and control (C2): use of a covert channel or backdoor between server and compromised network or machine to communicate with and control the machine or network. 87
- Bots: automated script or tool that performs some malicious activity. Group of bots that are under the same control is called a botnet. Botnet is used for DDoS attacks. 86
- Cryptomalware: malware that attempts to encrypt data files on any drives. Used as a form of ransomware where user is unable to access files without encryption key they have to pay for. 89
 - Logic bombs: malicious code that is set to run at a pre-configured date or time. 89
- Spyware: malware that performs tracking and monitoring, takes screenshots, activates recording devices. 65
 	- Keyloggers: spyware that attempts to steal confidential info by recording keystrokes. 85
 - Remote access Trojan (RAT): backdoor malware that is capable of operating covertly. Allows the actor to access the host, upload files, install software and change settings. 86
 - Rootkit: malware that modifies system files at kernel level to conceal its presence. 87
 - Backdoor: access method to a host that circumvents the usual authentication method and gives the remote user administrative control. 86
• Password attacks 159
- Spraying: horizontal brute force online attack where attacker chooses one or more common passwords and tries them in conjunction with multiple usernames. Bypasses account lockout policies. 159
- Dictionary attack: software generates hash values from a dictionary of plaintexts to try to match one to a captured hash. Predefined list of words. 160
- Brute force: attempts every possible combination in the output space in order to match a captured hash and guess at the plaintext that generated it. 160
- Offline attack: attacker obtained a database of password hashes and the cracker does not interact with the authentication system… will only be seen in an audit log or presence of attack tools on host. 159
- Online: attacker interacts with the authentication service directly and submits passwords using a database of known passwords or a list of passwords that have been cracked offline. 159
- Rainbow table: attacker uses a precomputed lookup table of all possible passwords and their matching hashes… slow down this attack by adding a salt. 160
- Plaintext/unencrypted attack: exploits password storage or a network authentication protocol that does not use encryption…protocols such as PAP, HTTP/FTP, and Telnet. 159
• Physical attacks
- Malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable: modified USB device that can be used as a keylogger. 321 
- Malicious flash drive: modified flash drive that can be used as a keylogger or a network device and corrupt name resolution. 321
- Card cloning: making one or more copies of a card. Can be indicated through use in a suspicious location of time of day. 543
- Skimming: using a counterfeit card reader to capture card details which is then used to program a duplicate… threat actor can have a portable RFID reader on them to capture credentials. 543
• Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI): manipulated sample data injected into AI that affects the training/learning of the AI in a way to prevent it from achieving its intended security objectives. 480
 - Tainted training data for machine learning (ML)
 - Security of machine learning algorithms: they are sensitive to noise
• Supply-chain attacks: attacker can infiltrate multiple companies linked through supply chain. 23
• Cloud-based vs. on-premises attacks: software and configuration vulnerabilities and third-party vendor management can exist on a private network or on the cloud. 55
• Cryptographic attacks
- Birthday attack: a type of brute force attack aimed at exploiting collisions in hash functions. Can be used for forging a digital signature. Benign document and malicious one, take signature from benign and throw it on the malicious one. Probability theory. 117 
 - Collision: when a function produces the same hash value for two different plaintexts. 117
- Downgrade attack: can facilitate a man-in-the-middle attack by requesting that the server use a lower specification protocol with weaker ciphers and key lengths. 116

1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks.
• Privilege escalation: attacker can access functionality or data that should not be available to them (vertical privilege escalation) or attacker can access functionality or data that is intended for another user (horizontal privilege escalation). 366
• Cross-site scripting: inserting a malicious script that appears to be part of a trusted site. 376
• Injections: exploits an unsecure way in which an application processes requests & query. 378
- Structured query language (SQL) injection: attacker modifies the select, insert, delete or update functions by adding code to some input accepted by the app, causing it to execute the attacker’s own set of SQL queries…they can extract or insert info into the database or execute arbitrary code using the same privileges as the database application. Countermeasure: stored procedures & input validation. 378
- Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection: vulnerability in the way the operating system allows one process to attach to another making it so that a legitimate process is forced to load a malicious link library. DLL must be operating with sufficient privileges already and evade detection by antivirus software. 369
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection: LDAP is a query language used to read and write network directory databases… threat actor can exploit unauthenticated access or a vulnerability in a client app to submit arbitrary LDAP queries… this would allow accounts to be created or deleted or for the attacker to change privileges and authorizations. Adding filter parameters as unsanitized input can bypass access controls. 
- Extensible Markup Language (XML) injection: XML is used by apps for authentications and authorizations and data exchange and uploading. Data needs encryption and input validation so it does not become susceptible to spoofing, request forgery and code injection. 378
• Pointer/object dereference: pointer is a variable that stores a memory location; pointer dereferencing is attempting to read or write a memory address via the pointer that produces the memory location as invalid or null… this might allow a threat actor to run arbitrary code.
• Race conditions: when the outcome from an execution process is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events, and those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer. 368
 	- Time of check/time of use: when there is a change between when an app checked a resource and when the app used the resource. Attacker will attempt to manipulate data after it has been checked but before it has been used by the application. 368
• Directory traversal: injection attack performed against a web server. Threat actor submits a request for a file outside the web server’s root directory by submitting a path to navigate to the parent directory… if input is not filtered. (../)
• Buffer overflows: attacker passes data that deliberately overfills the buffer, which is an area of memory that is reserved to store expected data. Get unpredictable results. 367
• Error handling: process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in a program. Application should not reveal configuration or platform details when there is an error. 367
• Improper input handling/validation: input should be tested to ensure that it is valid. Attacks pass invalid or maliciously constructed data to the vulnerable process. Exp Overflow or injection attacks. 367
• Replay attack: sniffing or guessing the token value and then submitting it to re-establish the session illegitimately. 374
- Session replays: replaying a cookie… attackers sniff network traffic to obtain session cookies sent over an unsecured network. Identify possible weakness in the generation of session tokens so attacker can’t predict future valid tokens and take over a session that has yet to be established. 375
• Integer overflow: causes target software to calculate a value that excess the upper and lower bounds of integers causing a positive number to become negative etc. 368



• Request forgeries 
- Server-side: 380. Causes server application to process an arbitrary request that targets another service. Exploits the lack of authentication between internal servers and services and weak input validation. 380
- Cross-site: 375. exploit applications that use cookies to authenticate users & track sessions
• Application programming interface (API) attacks: APIs allow consumers to automate services. API must be used over an encrypted channel (HTTPS). Vulnerabilities include ineffective secrets management, lack of input validation, error messages revealing clues, or DoS attacks. 374
• Resource exhaustion: overuse of CPU time, system memory allocation, fixed disk capacity and network utilization. Exp. DoS attack. 368
• Memory leak: continue to consume memory even after a program no longer requires the block of memory because it doesn’t release it… this could be due to a corrupted process. 368
• Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping: on path + downgrade attack. performed on clients on a local network as they try to make connections to websites. First is man-in-the-middle attack via ARP poisoning to masquerade default gateway. Then client requests an HTTP site that redirects to an HTTPS site unsafely and the sslstrip utility serves the client the HTTP site in unencrypted manner. SSL is a deprecated encryption protocol. 376
•	Driver manipulation
- Shimming: attacker inserts malicious code into a legitimate process or application. Alters the external behavior of an application but no changes to application code. 369
- Refactoring: code performs the same function by using different methods. Modifies the application’s code without changing its external behavior. 369
• Pass the hash: process of harvesting an account’s cached credentials when the user is logged into a single- sign-on system so the attacker can use the credentials on other systems. Provide the hash, don’t need plaintext in order to authenticate. 369

1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with network attacks.
• Wireless
- Evil twin: a rogue wireless access point masquerading as a legitimate one… does this by having a similar name SSID to the real one or by using a DoS technique to overcome the real WAP… authentication security must be enabled on the WAP. Used for eavesdropping. 243
- Rogue access point: access point that has been installed on the network without authorization. 243
- Bluesnarfing: using an exploit to circumvent the authentication mechanism in Bluetooth to steal info from someone’s phone. Unauthorized access. 359
- Bluejacking: spam where someone sends you unsolicited text/pic/vid or contact info. 359
- Disassociation/ deauthentication: send a stream of spoofed frames to cause a client to deauthenticate from a WAP… MAC address of the target station is spoofed, opening up vulnerability to replay attack. Temporary DoS. 244
- Wifi Jamming: setting up a WAP w/ a stronger signal to interfere w/ the wireless network. Type of DoS. 245
- Radio frequency identification (RFID): way to encode info into passive tags that can be attached to devices. Type of RFID attack is skimming. Vulnerable to spoofing, eavesdropping, data interception, replay attacks and DoS attacks. 359
- Near-field communication (NFC): standard for peer-to-peer radio communications over very short distances, facilitating contactless payment… based off RFID. No encryption. Vulnerable to data interception, replay attacks, DoS attacks. 359
- Initialization vector (IV) attack: a wireless attack where the attacker is able to predict or control the IV of an encryption process, thus giving the attacker access to view the encrypted data that is supposed to be hidden from everyone else except the user or network. Attempt to discover the passphrase. 245
• On-path attack (man-in-the-middle attack): threat actor gains a position between two hosts, and transparently captures, monitors, and relays all communication between the hosts. 228
• Layer 2 attacks  data link layer…focused on information gathering
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning: use of a packet crafter to broadcast unsolicited ARP reply packets; the receiving devices trust the communication and update their MAC: IP address cache table with the spoofed address. 228
- Media access control (MAC) flooding: exhaust the memory used to store the switch’s MAC address table, switch stops trying to apply MAC-based forwarding & flood unicast traffic out of all ports… makes sniffing network traffic easier. 228
- MAC cloning/spoofing: attacker falsifies the factory-assigned MAC address of a device’s network interface card (NIC). 227
• Domain name system (DNS) (layer 7) resolves fully qualified domain names to IP addresses. Port 53.
- Domain hijacking: an adversary gains control over the registration of a domain name and acquires the domain for a company’s trading name or trademark or a spelling variation. 285
- DNS poisoning: an attack that compromises the process by which clients query name servers to locate the IP address for a FQDN... can be done through man-in-the-middle, DNS client cache poisoning, DNS server cache poisoning. Direct client to any dest. 286
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) redirection: pharming; the use of HTTP redirects to open a page other than the one the user requested. Hosts enables client-side URL redirection. 286
- Domain reputation: domains that have been hijacked will lead to complaints and may even be blacklisted. 286
• Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS): attack is done by multiple hosts simultaneously… point is to consume network bandwidth or do resource exhaustion. 247 
 	- Network: SYN or SYN/ACK flooding. 247
- Application: targets vulnerabilities in the headers and payloads of specific application protocols. 247

1.6 Explain the security concerns associated with various types of vulnerabilities.
• Cloud-based vs. on-premises vulnerabilities: on private network vs on cloud. Shared responsibility model (CSP secures the cloud, consumer responsible for security in cloud). 55
• Zero-day: a vulnerability that is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch. 51
• Weak configurations
- Manufacturer default settings: may leave unsecure interfaces enabled. 51
- Unsecure root accounts/default admin account: has no restrictions over system access… need effective user management and authorization policies… least privilege. 51
- Open permissions: provisioning data files or applications without differentiating access rights for user groups. Read and write access permissions. 52
- Open ports and services: increases attack surface. Restrict access, disable unused services, block port with firewall, segment the network. 52
- Unsecure protocols: transfers data as cleartext and does not have encryption for data protection. No secure way to authenticate endpoints. Man-in-the-middle susceptible. 52
- Weak encryption: allow unauthorized access to data. Password length and complexity to avoid brute force. 52
 - Errors: errors should not reveal info that could assist the development of an exploit. 53
• Third-party risks
- Vendor management: assess risks when determining whether to outsource all or part of a workflow and have contingency plans if a vendor does not perform as expected. 54
- System integration: using components or services from multiple vendors to implement a business workflow. 54
- Lack of vendor support: retooling the workflow to use a different vendor can be complex. 54
- Supply chain: 
- Outsourced code development: use different vendors for code development and for vulnerability and penetration testing to make sure you are using secure code. 55
- Data storage: vendor access to your data and vendor hosting your data and data backups… ensure authorization, access management, encryption, compliance. 55
• Improper or weak patch management
- Firmware: vulnerabilities in BIOS/UEFI that controls the boot process, also in network cards and disk controllers… can run with the highest level of privilege. 50
- Operating system (OS): vulnerability in the OS kernel file likely leads to privilege escalation. 50
 	- Applications: 
• Legacy platforms: one that is no longer supported with security patches by its developer or vendor and this highly vulnerable to exploits. 51
• Impacts
 	- Data loss: info becomes unavailable temporarily or permanently. 53
 	- Data breaches: confidential data is read or transferred without authorization. 53

- False negatives: potential vulnerabilities that are not identified in a scan and thus go undetected. 62
 	- Log reviews: see what processes have failed. 62
- Credentialed vs. non-credentialed: user account within log-on rights plus permissions for testing vs directing test packets at a host without being able to log on to the OS or app. 61
- Intrusive vs. non-intrusive: run code to gain access to system vs probing the device’s config using a network connection w/ the target vs analyzing indirect evidence (traffic). 60
- Application scanners are configured with detailed scripts to test for known attacks as well as scanning for missing patches and weak configurations. 59
- Web application: type of application scanner…detects web exploits such as SQP injection and XSS. 59

• Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR): integrated with a SIEM… scan the organization’s store of security and threat intelligence, analyze it using machine/deep learning, use the data to automate and provide data enrichment for workflows that drive incident response and threat hunting. 278

1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing
• Penetration testing/ethical hacking: authorized hacking to discover exploitable weaknesses in the security system. 67
- Known environment (white box): consultant is given complete access to information about the network… simulates a privileged insider threat. 68
- Unknown environment (black box): consultant is given no privileged information about the network and its security systems… simulates an external threat. 68
- Partially known environment (grey box): consultant is given some information about the network… simulates an unprivileged insider threat. 68
- Rules of engagement: specify what activity is permitted or not… made explicit in a contractual agreement… objective + scope. 67
- Persistence: tester’s ability to reconnect to the compromised host and use it as a RAT or backdoor… must establish command and control. 70
- Privilege escalation: gain greater level of access. 70
- Lateral movement: gaining control over other hosts… usually done PowerShell. 70
- Pivoting: pivot allows tester to bypass a network boundary and compromise servers on an inside network… accomplished using remote access and tunneling protocols (SSH, VPN). 70 
- Cleanup: removing evidence of the attack… evidence of backdoors. 70
- Bug bounty: program where rewards are given for reporting vulnerabilities…crowd sourcing 68

2.0 Architecture and Design
2.1 Explain the importance of security concepts in an enterprise environment.
• Configuration management: ensures that each component of information and communications technology (ICT) is in a trusted state that has not diverged from its documented properties. 530
- Diagrams: best way to capture the complex relationships between network elements… show how configuration items (CIs) are involved in business workflows, etc. 531
- Baseline configuration: template of settings that a device was configured to and that it should continue to match. 530
- Standard naming conventions: consistent way of naming hardware assets and digital assets so that errors are easier to spot and easier to automate scripting. Rules for host & DNS names. 531
- Internet protocol (IP) schema: address that is used to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. Easier to apply firewall access control lists (ACLs), perform security monitoring, makes configuration errors less likely & easier to detect, identify manual or static vs DHCP address. 531
• Data sovereignty: a jurisdiction preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems that do not physically reside within that jurisdiction. 443
• Data protection: 
- Data loss prevention (DLP): automate the discovery and classification of data types and enforce rules so that data is not viewed or transferred without proper authorization. 449
 - Masking: all of parts of the contents of a field are redacted xxx. 452
- Encryption: used to mitigate the risk that an authorization mechanism can be revoked. 447
- At rest: data is in some sort of persistent storage media… data should be encrypted. 447
- In transit/motion: data is transmitted over a network… exp website traffic, data being synced between cloud repos… protected by a transport encryption protocol (TLS or IPSec). 447
- In processing/in use: data is present in volatile memory such as system RAM or CPU registers and cache… 447
- Tokenization: all or part of the data field is replaced with a randomly generated token which is stored along with the original value in a token server. 452
 - Rights management: file permissions, restrict printing and forwarding 
• Geographical considerations: mitigate data sovereignty issues and employees needing access from multiple geographic locations. 443
• Response and recovery controls
• Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection: to secure application protocols… digital certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority… encrypted comms. 292
• Hashing: produces a fixed length string from an arbitrary length plaintext… prove integrity. 452
• API considerations: secrets management requirements and ensure only authorized endpoints are making transactions. 295
• Site resiliency
 	- Hot site: can failover almost immediately. 532
 	- Cold site: takes longer to set up… empty building. 533
 	- Warm site: latest dataset will need to be loaded. 533
• Deception and disruption
- Honeypots: computer system set up to attract threat actors, with the intention of analyzing attack strategies and tools, to provide early warming of attack attempts, or possibly as a decoy to divert attention from actual computer systems… used to detect fraud, snooping, malpractice. 534
- Honeyfiles: convincingly useful but actually fake data that is usually trackable so that when a threat actor successfully exfiltrates it, the attempts to reuse or exploit it can be traced. 535
 	- Honeynets: an entire decoy network. 534
 - Fake telemetry: deception strategy that returns spoofed data in response to network. 535
 	- DNS sinkhole: sinkhole server that routes suspect traffic so that it can be analyzed. 535

2.2 Summarize virtualization and cloud computing concepts
• Cloud models
